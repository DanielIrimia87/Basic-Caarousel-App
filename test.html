                <h3>Giant Tortoise</h3>
                <p>The giant tortoise is an iconic species from the Galápagos and is only found on these islands. They
                    are the largest living tortoise in the world.</p>

                <h3>Amur Leopard</h3>
                <p>The Amur leopard is important ecologically, economically and culturally. Conservation of its habitat
                    benefits other species, including Amur tigers and prey species like deer. With the right
                    conservation efforts, we can bring them back and ensure long-term conservation of the region.</p>

                <h3>African Forest Elephant</h3>
                <p>Forest elephants are found in dense forests and are essential for the germination of many rain forest
                    trees. The seeds of these trees only germinate after passing through the elephant’s digestive tract.

                <h3>African Wild Dog</h3>
                <p>Major threats to the survival of wild dogs include accidental and targeted killings by humans, viral
                    diseases like rabies and distemper, habitat loss and competition with larger predators like lions.
                    Conflicts occur when wild dogs come in contact with people whose livelihoods rest largely on
                    livestock and agriculture. Problems arise when expanding human activities decrease the habitat for
                    available prey for wild dogs.</p>

                <h3>Eastern Lowland Gorilla</h3>
                <p>The eastern lowland gorilla’s range has declined by at least a quarter over the last 50 years. The
                    last census, in the mid-1990s, estimated that there were only 16,900 of the animals left in the
                    wild, but following more than a decade of habitat destruction and fragmentation and years of civil
                    unrest, the eastern lowland gorilla’s population may have declined by half or more.</p>
